[ ] BUG: Carving removes too much eg room 6.

[ ] Design some further level maps
[ ] Droids can shoot ghost - should not happen
[ ] Hi-score table (although we need a proper font for this).
[ ] Sweep up numeric literals into constant declarations.
[ ] Open maximised
[ ] Proper parser state machine for loading levels so we can report line numbers very easily.
[ ] Different types of brick for walls, and different decoration formats.
[ ] Screen stretching like Jynx.
[ ] Droid firing -- more aggressive as levels progress.
[ ] Ghost timing -- change as levels progress?
[ ] Penalise shooting inaccuracy on later levels?


[X] PAUSE GAME key.
[X] implement level switching.
[X] Choose adversaries by level number. Red monsters on level 1 only.  Introduce blues on level 2 etc...
[X] New level init
[X] Choose the objects that should be placed, by level number.  
[X] BUG: Getting assert in ForEachDo() still -- trace where from.  There is still a container invalidation issue.
[X] New game init
[X] end game.
[X] Title screen needed.  Just use large sprites of instructions.  Cycle between.
[X] Ideally monsters should not be positioned too close to the man when he enters a new room.
[X] Increase lives at 10,000 points
[X] Revisit the positioner -- it was going to place keys etc and all the droids.
[X] Possibly unify the containers for droids and keys/door/etc...  man / ghost too.
[X] Lose life, pause for a bit, restart room, or 
[X] BUG: Droid are obstructed by explosions.  We need to handle this.
[X] Moving rooms invalidates the entire ObjectsInRoom container, which crashes ForEachDo() that
    is currently handling the AdvanceOneCycle() that caused the room-switch.  In fact, the
	ForEachDo() no longer applies at the point of the room-switch.
[X] BUG: LoseLife does not restore the correct facing direction as it was on room entry (seen in first room).
