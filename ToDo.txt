[ ] Droids can shoot ghost - should not happen
[ ] Ideally monsters should not be positioned too close to the man when he enters a new room.
[ ] Increase lives at 10,000 points
[ ] Revisit the positioner -- it was going to place keys etc and all the droids.
[ ] Possibly unify the containers for droids and keys/door/etc...  man / ghost too.
[ ] Title screen needed.  Just use large sprites of instructions.  Cycle between.
[ ] Hi-score table (although we need a proper font for this).
[ ] Lose life, pause for a bit, restart room, or end game.
[ ] PAUSE GAME key.
[ ] Sweep up numeric literals into constant declarations.
[ ] Open maximised
[ ] New game init
[ ] New level init
[ ] Droid are obstructed by explosions.  We need to handle this.
