Release 1
---------

[ ] The facing direction of the man on level 1 is not good for turning against the monsters (unfair on new players)
[ ] Design a music handling class, and reinstate the title screen music.

 

Release 2
---------
[ ] Score sapping by homing droids -- a fraction of the score on room entry is taken.
[ ] Fix the location of the key (etc) at start of level, not per room-start.
[ ] Persist the hi score table
[ ] Seed the resampling thresholds from the level number, independently of the floor/walls.
[ ] Brick choice thresholding:  Vary per room.  Varience depends on level number.
[ ] "Death" robot.  Homing and fast.  Can be shot.
[ ] Homing droid variants that are faster.
[ ] Do the all the proposed refactorings (g.txt)
[ ] Refactor to introduce struct FacingDirection
[ ] Base class routine to fire, calls derived to get the sound effect.
[ ] Proper parser state machine for loading levels so we can report line numbers very easily.
[ ] Open maximised
[ ] Ghost timing -- change as levels progress?
[ ] Penalise shooting inaccuracy on later levels?
[ ] Cycle counts for animation in a configuration file?
[ ] Skin folder - but with one skin only for now.  The software must dynamically load the graphics, and not use the monogame Content system.
[ ] Selection of skins.
[ ] A second droid type for level 1:  WanderingMine
[ ] Red versions of the yellow droids:  They fire perpendicular to travel?
[ ] Boss robots that are larger and take more hits to kill.
[ ] Show a 'bonus' sprite.

[X] Static hi score MODEL
[X] hi score screen control only created in the hi-score screen mode object.
[X] The level 2 pattern is too coarse to use.  Replace with something else.
[X] Ghost should appear from corner furthest away from man.

[X] Hi score cursor needed.
[X] Duo bonus - multi shot with same bullet instance
[X] Some bypass keys to later levels -- 2346789ERTYPAFGH
[X] Different bullet sounds by monster type.
[X] SELECT and ESC close game.
[X] Change the droid firing sound to something more sophisticated?
[X] Use of the font to display messages, and get rid of the special number sprites.  Need to stretch font width ways.

[X] NO:  Start letters in the middle.  

[X] Solution SLN name and window title is silly.
[X] Joystick!!
[X] Hiscore screen after entry - must do release waiting on the final FIRE button, before switching!
    Perhaps the caller takes the screen away too soon because the edit mode status clears
	immediately that the FIRE button goes DOWN on the last letter.
[X] F11 full screen
	
[X] Test the name entry on hiscore.
[X] Don't cycle digits on the hiscore screen!	
[X] Textures for walls and floors, re-coloured.
[X] Delay before fire can start the game on the title screen.  Avoids accidental game starts.
[X] NO:  Firing  Up/Down or Left/Right travellers. -- They easily destroy too much.
[X] Show the level number on the "entering" screen.
[X] Blue droid logic:  Stuck to doorways since new logic?  Bouncing off walls is better though.
[X] Font
[ ] NOT DOING:  Droid firing -- more aggressive as levels progress. - NO: Just have different types of droids.
[X] Have a selection of explosion sounds and randomly select.
[X] Have a selection of flooring sprites (darkish).
[ ] NOT DOING: Render outlines around walls properly - I may just stick with the bricks.
[X] Prefix all sound file names with "Sound" to avoid name clashes.
[X] Design a different map for level 1.
[X] Use all of the numbered sound files.
[X] Design some further level maps
[X] MUST DO - Replace all the copyright graphics.
[X] Different types of brick for walls.
[X] A third monster type is needed.
[X] Screen stretching like Jynx and keypresses for this.
[X] Instruction screens -- do with a single SpriteTraits, and rotate the images.
[X] Different scores per robot type.
[X] Need to increase score when collecting objects.
[X] The level start position is not defined.  Have a character in the source file to specify it.
    And calculate the facing direction for the man on startup.
[X] Droids can shoot ghost - should not happen

[X] BUG: Carving removes too much eg room 106.
[X] PAUSE GAME key.
[X] implement level switching.
[X] Choose adversaries by level number. Red monsters on level 1 only.  Introduce blues on level 2 etc...
[X] New level init
[X] Choose the objects that should be placed, by level number.  
[X] BUG: Getting assert in ForEachDo() still -- trace where from.  There is still a container invalidation issue.
[X] New game init
[X] end game.
[X] Title screen needed.  Just use large sprites of instructions.  Cycle between.
[X] Ideally monsters should not be positioned too close to the man when he enters a new room.
[X] Increase lives at 10,000 points
[X] Revisit the positioner -- it was going to place keys etc and all the droids.
[X] Possibly unify the containers for droids and keys/door/etc...  man / ghost too.
[X] Lose life, pause for a bit, restart room, or 
[X] BUG: Droid are obstructed by explosions.  We need to handle this.
[X] Moving rooms invalidates the entire ObjectsInRoom container, which crashes ForEachDo() that
    is currently handling the AdvanceOneCycle() that caused the room-switch.  In fact, the
	ForEachDo() no longer applies at the point of the room-switch.
[X] BUG: LoseLife does not restore the correct facing direction as it was on room entry (seen in first room).

[X] Refactor the title screens.  the hiscore integration is a hack.  Restore the class, but the loop will have to go
    back to the hiscore screen.
    eg:   class ImagePlateShowScreen (sprite)
	eg:   class HiScoreScreen

[X] Hi-score table entry after a good game.
