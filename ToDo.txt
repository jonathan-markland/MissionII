[ ] Droids can shoot ghost - should not happen
[ ] Title screen needed.  Just use large sprites of instructions.  Cycle between.
[ ] Hi-score table (although we need a proper font for this).
[ ] end game.
[ ] PAUSE GAME key.
[ ] Sweep up numeric literals into constant declarations.
[ ] Open maximised
[ ] New game init
[ ] New level init
[ ] Red monsters on level 1 only.  Introduce blues on level 2 etc...
[ ] Carving removes too much.
[ ] Getting assert in ForEachDo() still -- trace where from.

[X] Ideally monsters should not be positioned too close to the man when he enters a new room.
[X] Increase lives at 10,000 points
[X] Revisit the positioner -- it was going to place keys etc and all the droids.
[X] Possibly unify the containers for droids and keys/door/etc...  man / ghost too.
[X] Lose life, pause for a bit, restart room, or 
[X] BUG: Droid are obstructed by explosions.  We need to handle this.
[X] Moving rooms invalidates the entire ObjectsInRoom container, which crashes ForEachDo() that
    is currently handling the AdvanceOneCycle() that caused the room-switch.  In fact, the
	ForEachDo() no longer applies at the point of the room-switch.
[X] BUG: LoseLife does not restore the correct facing direction as it was on room entry (seen in first room).
